The scene is an indoor awards ceremony stage where a man and a woman are standing at a podium. A man concludes a brief statement, which is immediately followed by a loud burst of applause and cheering from a large off-screen crowd. As the applause begins its long, reverberant decay, the woman standing beside him laughs or exclaims briefly. The acoustics are characteristic of a large hall with strong reverberation, which contrasts with the direct, close-miked clarity of the speech. <TRACK name='male_speech' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> clear direct close_miked reverberant </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='audience_applause_and_cheering' count=1 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> loud burst decaying reverberant dense whoops </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='female_vocalization' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> laugh exclamation high_pitched </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
