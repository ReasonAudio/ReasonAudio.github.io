This stop-motion animation is set in a stylized outdoor pen featuring several claymation sheep. The audio begins with a standard sheep bleat, followed immediately by a more comical, elongated bleat from the main character. An upbeat, acoustic theme song then begins, featuring jaunty plucked string instruments layered with numerous rhythmic sheep bleats. The overall acoustics are clean and dry, characteristic of a studio recording with clear transients. <TRACK name='sheep_bleating' count=2 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> vocal nasal comical mid_pitch </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='acoustic_theme_music' count=1 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> upbeat rhythmic jaunty plucked strings </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
