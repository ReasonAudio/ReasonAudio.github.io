The scene takes place at an outdoor elephant enclosure at a zoo, with one elephant close to the camera behind a wooden fence. The audio begins with faint, off-screen human speech, which is abruptly interrupted by a loud, high-pitched trumpet from the foreground elephant. A sharp, resonant thump follows the vocalization, after which the human conversation continues more clearly. The overall acoustics are moderately reverberant, likely from nearby walls, making the loud animal and impact sounds stand out. <TRACK name='human_speech' count=2 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> conversational female voices background </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='elephant_trumpet' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> loud high_pitched squeal resonant </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='impact' count=1 screen=uncertain> <KEYWORDS> sharp bang thump resonant </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
