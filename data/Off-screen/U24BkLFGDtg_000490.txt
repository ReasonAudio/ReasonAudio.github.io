In an outdoor savanna setting, a baby elephant sits on a dirt road, protected by its mother and another adult elephant. The scene is filled with a continuous, deep elephant rumble from the beginning, layered with the faint, high-frequency buzzing of insects. Towards the end, a tusked elephant approaches and emits a powerful, sharp trumpet call. The acoustics are open and natural, dominated by the resonant, low-frequency vocalizations. <TRACK name='elephant_rumble' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> low_frequency sustained deep powerful resonant </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='insect_buzzing' count=1 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> high_frequency faint continuous </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='elephant_trumpet' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> loud burst sharp piercing powerful call </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
