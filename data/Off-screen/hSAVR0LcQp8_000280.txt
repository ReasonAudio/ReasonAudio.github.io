The scene is a computer-animated city at dawn, with the camera slowly zooming toward a hospital. A distant ambulance siren begins, rapidly approaching and passing by, followed immediately by a second siren that traces the same path. Finally, the chopping sound of helicopter rotor blades begins as a helicopter appears on the hospital's rooftop helipad. The acoustics are dominated by the clear far-to-near dynamics and prominent Doppler effect of the wailing sirens. <TRACK name='ambulance_siren' count=2 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> wailing doppler effect approaching receding </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='helicopter' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> rotor blades rhythmic chopping mechanical </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
