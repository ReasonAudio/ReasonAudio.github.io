This video captures a first-person perspective of someone standing on and then tumbling down a snowy mountain slope. The audio begins with faint, distant shouts and wind, which are abruptly replaced by a loud, chaotic scraping and rushing sound as the person slides down the hill. This intense sound of friction and turbulence continues until the person comes to a stop, followed by a close-up, heavy exhale. The overall acoustics are dominated by the near-field, high-energy turbulent noise of the slide, contrasting with the initially distant environmental sounds. <TRACK name='wind' count=1 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> broadband noise turbulent rushing </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='distant_human_speech' count=1 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> distant muffled indistinct chatter </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='human_vocalization' count=2 screen=off_screen> <KEYWORDS> close_mic effort grunt breathy exhale </KEYWORDS> </TRACK> <TRACK name='sliding_on_snow' count=1 screen=on_screen> <KEYWORDS> friction scraping turbulent rush granular </KEYWORDS> </TRACK>
